# Detection & Monitoring with Active Directory Lab

## Objective 
The Detection Lab project aimed to mimic an enterprise environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (Splunk), and generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios using Kali Linux to perform a brute force attack agianst users in a Active Directory Domain and Atomic Red team to Emulate adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations from the MITRE ATT&CK framework database. 

### Skills Learned

- Configuring and managing Active Directory domain environments
- Setting up and utilizing Splunk for security event monitoring and analysis
- Simulating bruteforce attack using Kali Linux
- Performing cybersecurity tests using Atomic Red Team.
- Identifying and interpreting security events generated from attacks via Splunk
- Analyzing and correlating security events in Splunk with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
